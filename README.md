# RNN

A Matlab package for training and testing recurrent neural networks (RNN). The package also contains a few helper functions to assist with various training methods and tasks.

There main files are:

**RNN.m**: Class definition for the RNN. Contains methods for instantiating, training, and running the model. Training is accomplished mainly using the innate learning rule.

  **TrainRNN_TempInv.m**: Function to train RNNs to produce temporally invariant activity (temporal scaling).

  **TestRNN.m**: Function to test RNNs.

  **TrainOut.m**: Function to train the output units of the RNN.
